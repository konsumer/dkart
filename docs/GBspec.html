   The information contained in this document is extracted from an old PanDoc file called GBspec.txt or something
   similar. I removed the things I thought were already covered in the other file (the Pan docs file, as can be
   found in
   <a href="index.html" target="_top">the navigation frame</a>)
   so there might be elements that you already read somewhere.
   <br>
   Still, I have the impression that this file does cover some ground not present in the other file.

  <p class = "header">Echo of 8kB Internal RAM</p>
  
  <p>
   The addresses E000-FE00 appear to access the internal RAM the same as C000-DE00. (i.e. If you write a byte to
   address E000 it will appear at C000 and E000. Similarly, writing a byte to C000 will appear at C000 and E000.)
  </p>
  
  <p class = "header">User I/O</p>
  
  <p>
   There are no empty spaces in the memory map for implementing input ports except the switchable RAM bank area
   (not an option on the Super Smart Card since it's RAM bank is always enabled).
  </p>
  <p>
   An output only port may be implemented anywhere between A000-FDFF. If implemented in a RAM area care should be
   taken to use an area of RAM not used for anything else. (FE00 and above can't be used because the CPU doesn't
   generate an external /WR for these locations.)
  </p>
  <p>
   If you have a cart with an MBC1, a ROM 4Mbit or smaller, and a RAM 8Kbyte or smaller (or no RAM) then you can
   use pins 6 & 7 of the MBC1 for 2 digital output pins for whatever purpose you wish. To use them you must first
   put the MBC1 into 4MbitROM/32KbyteRAM mode by writing 01 to 6000. The two least significant bits you write to
   4000 will then be output to these pins.
  </p>
  
  <p class = "header">Reserved Memory Locations</p>

   The following is a table of reserved memory addresses in ROM space. If you need either interrupt to be
   serviced, here are the entry points for the possible interrupt sources.

    <tr>
     <td valign="top">MBC1</td>
     <td>
      MBC1 has two different maximum memory modes:
      <ul>
       <li>16 Mbit ROM / 8 KByte RAM</li>
       <li> 4 Mbit ROM / 32 KByte RAM</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The MBC1 defaults to 16 Mbit ROM / 8 KByte RAM mode on power up. Writing a value (0000000S - S = Memory
       model select) into 6000-7FFF area will select the memory model to use. S = 0 selects 16/8 mode. S = 1
       selects 4/32 mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       Writing a value (000BBBBB - B = bank select bits) into 2000-3FFF area will select an appropriate ROM bank
       at 4000-7FFF. Values of 00000 and 00001 do the same thing and point to ROM bank 1. ROM bank 0 is not
       accessible from 4000-7FFF and can only be read from 0000-3FFF.
      </p>
      <p>
      If memory model is set to 4/32: Writing a value (000000BB - B = bank select bits) into 4000-5FFF area will
      select an appropriate RAM bank at A000-C000. Before you can read or write to a RAM bank you have to enable
      it by writing a 00001010 into 0000-1FFF area*. 
      <br>
      To disable RAM bank operations write any value but 00001010 into 0000-1FFF area. Disabling a RAM bank
      probably protects that bank from false writes during power down of the GameBoy. 
      </p>
      <p>
       (NOTE: Nintendo suggests values $0A to enable and $00 to disable RAM bank!!)
      </p>
      <p>
       If memory model is set to 16/8 mode: Writing a value (000000BB - B = bank select bits) into 4000-5FFF area
       will set the two most significant ROM address lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       * NOTE: The Super Smart Card doesn't require this operation because it's RAM bank is ALWAYS enabled.
       Include this operation anyway to allow your code to work with both.

      This memory controller works much like the MBC1 controller with the following exceptions:
      <ol type="a">
       <li>MBC2 will work with ROM sizes up to 2Mbit.</li>
       <li>
        Writing a value (0000BBBB - B = bank select bits) into 2000-3FFF area will select an appropriate ROM
	bank at 4000-7FFF.
       </li>
       <li>
        RAM switching is not provided. Unlike the MBC1 which uses external RAM, MBC2 has 512 x 4 bits of RAM
	which is in the controller itself. It still requires an external battery to save data during power-off
	though.
       </li>
       <li>
        The least significant bit of the upper address byte must be zero to enable or disable cart RAM. For
	example the following addresses can be used to enable or disable cart RAM: 0000-00FF, 0200-02FF,
	0400-04FF, ..., 1E00-1EFF. The suggested address range to use for MBC2 ram enable / disable is 0000-00FF.
       </li>
       <li>
        The least significant bit of the upper address byte must be "1" to select a ROM bank. For example the
	following addresses can be used to select a ROM bank: 2100-21FF, 2300-23FF, 2500-25FF, ..., 3F00-3FFF.
	The suggested address range to use for MBC2 rom bank selection is 2100-21FF.

      appropriate ROM bank at 4000-7FFF.
      <p>
      Also, this MBC has a built-in battery-backed Real Time Clock (RTC) not found in any other MBC. Some MBC3

       <br>
       It is similar to the MBC3 (but no RTC) but can access up to 64 Mbits of ROM and up to 1 Mbit of RAM. The
       lower 8 bits of the 9-bit ROM bank select is written to the 2000-2FFF area while the upper bit is written
       to the least significant bit of the 3000-3FFF area.

       <br>
       Also, this is the first MBC that allows ROM bank 0 to appear in the 4000-7FFF range by writing $0000 to

      the rumble cart.
      <br>
      Writing a value (0000MBBB - M = motor, B = bank select bits) into 4000-5FFF area will select an appropriate

  <p class = "header">Stop Mode</p>
  
  <p>
   The STOP command halts the GameBoy processor and screen until any button is pressed. The GB and GBP screen
   goes white with a single dark horizontal line. The GBC screen goes black.
  </p>
  
  <p class = "header">Low-Power Mode</p>
  
  <p>
   It is recommended that the HALT instruction be used whenever possible to reduce power consumption and extend
   the life of the batteries. This command stops the system clock reducing the power consumption of both the CPU
   and ROM.
  </p>
  <p>
   The CPU will remain suspended until an interrupt occurs at which point the interrupt is serviced and then the
   instruction immediately following the HALT is executed. If interrupts are disabled (DI) then halt doesn't
   suspend operation but it does cause the program counter to stop counting for one instruction on the GB, GBP
   and SGB as mentioned below.
  </p>
  <p>
   Depending on how much CPU time is required by a game, the HALT instruction can extend battery life anywhere
   from 5 to 50% or possibly more.
  </p>
  <p>
   <red>
    WARNING: The instruction immediately following the HALT instruction is "skipped" when interrupts are disabled
    (DI) on the GB, GBP, and SGB. As a result, always put a NOP after the HALT instruction. This instruction
    skipping doesn't occur when interrupts are enabled (EI). This "skipping" does not seem to occur on the
    GameBoy Color even in regular GB mode. ($143=$00)

  </p>
  <p>
   EXAMPLES from Martin Korth who documented this problem: (assuming interrupts disabled for all examples)
   <ol type="1">
    <li>
     This code causes the 'a' register to be incremented TWICE.
     <pre>
      76          halt
      3C          inc  a
     </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
     The next example is a bit more difficult. The following code
     <pre>
      76          halt
      FA 34 12    ld   a,(1234)
     </pre>
     is effectively executed as
     <pre>
      76          halt
      FA FA 34    ld   a,(34FA)
      12          ld   (de),a
     </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
     Finally an interesting side effect
     <pre>
      76          halt
      76          halt
     </pre>
     This combination hangs the cpu. The first HALT causes the second HALT to be repeated, which therefore causes
     the following command (=itself) to be repeated - again and again. Placing a NOP between the two halts would
     cause the NOP to be repeated once, the second HALT wouldn't lock the cpu.
    </li>

   The main GameBoy screen buffer (background) consists of 256x256 pixels or 32x32 tiles (8x8 pixels each). Only
   160x144 pixels can be displayed on the screen. Registers SCROLLX and SCROLLY hold the coordinates of
   background to be displayed in the left upper corner of the screen. Background wraps around the screen (i.e.
   when part of it goes off the screen, it appears on the opposite side.)
  </p>
  <p>
   An area of VRAM known as Background Tile Map contains the numbers of tiles to be displayed. It is organized as
   32 rows of 32 bytes each. Each byte contains a number of a tile to be displayed. Tile patterns are taken from
   the Tile Data Table located either at $8000-8FFF or $8800-97FF. In the first case, patterns are numbered with
   unsigned numbers from 0 to 255 (i.e. pattern #0 lies at address $8000). In the second case, patterns have
   signed numbers from -128 to 127 (i.e. pattern #0 lies at address $9000). The Tile Data Table address for the
   background can be selected by setting the LCDC register.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are two different Background Tile Maps. One is located from $9800-9Bff. The other from $9C00-9FFF. Only
   one of these can be viewed at any one time. The currently displayed background can be selected by setting the
   LCDC register.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides background, there is also a "window" overlaying the background. The window is not scrollable i.e. it
   is always displayed starting from its left upper corner. The location of a window on the screen can be
   adjusted via WNDPOSX and WNDPOSY registers. Screen coordinates of the top left corner of a window are
   WNDPOSX-7, WNDPOSY. The tile numbers for the window are stored in the Tile Data Table. None of the windows
   tiles are ever transparent. Both the Background and the window share the same Tile Data Table.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both background and window can be disabled or enabled separately via bits in the LCDC register.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the window is used and a scan line interrupt disables it (either by writing to LCDC or by setting WX &gt;
   166) and a scan line interrupt a little later on enables it then the window will resume appearing on the
   screen at the exact position of the window where it left off earlier. This way, even if there are only 16
   lines of useful graphics in the window, you could display the first 8 lines at the top of the screen and the
   next 8 lines at the bottom if you wanted to do so.
  </p>
  <p>
   WX may be changed during a scan line interrupt (to either cause a graphic distortion effect or to disable the
   window (WX &gt; 166) ) but changes to WY are not dynamic and won't be noticed until the next screen redraw.
  </p>
  <p>
   The tile images are stored in the Tile Pattern Tables. Each 8x8 image occupies 16 bytes, where each 2 bytes
   represent a line:
   <pre>
  Tile:                                     Image:

   As it was said before, there are two Tile Pattern Tables at $8000-8FFF and at $8800-97FF. The first one can be
   used for sprites, the background, and the window display. Its tiles are numbered from 0 to 255. The second
   table can be used for the background and the window display and its tiles are numbered from -128 to 127.
  </p>
  
  <p class = "header">Sprites</p>
  
  <p>
   GameBoy video controller can display up to 40 sprites either in 8x8 or in 8x16 pixels. Because of a limitation
   of hardware, only ten sprites can be displayed per scan line. Sprite patterns have the same format as tiles,
   but they are taken from the Sprite Pattern Table located at $8000-8FFF and have unsigned numbering. Sprite
   attributes reside in the Sprite Attribute Table (OAM - Object Attribute Memory) at $FE00-FE9F. OAM is divided
   into 40 4-byte blocks each of which corresponds to a sprite.
   <br>
   In 8x16 sprite mode, the least significant bit of the sprite pattern number is ignored and treated as 0.
  </p>
  <p>
   When sprites with different x coordinate values overlap, the one with the smaller x coordinate (closer to the
   left) will have priority and appear above any others.
  </p>
  <p>
   When sprites with the same x coordinate values overlap, they have priority according to table ordering. (i.e.
   $FE00 - highest, $FE04 - next highest, etc.)
   <br>
   Please note that Sprite X = 0, Y = 0 hides a sprite. To display a sprite use the following formulas:
   <pre>
 SpriteScreenPositionX (Upper left corner of sprite) = SpriteX - 8
 SpriteScreenPositionY (Upper left corner of sprite) = SpriteY - 16
   </pre>
   To display a sprite in the upper left corner of the screen set sprite X = 8, Y = 16.
  </p>
  <p>
   Only 10 sprites can be displayed on any one line. When this limit is exceeded, the lower priority sprites
   (priorities listed above) won't be displayed. To keep unused sprites from affecting onscreen sprites set their
   Y coordinate to Y = 0 or Y &gt;= 144 + 16. Just setting the X coordinate to X = 0 or X &gt;= 160 + 8 on a
   sprite will hide it but it will still affect other sprites sharing the same lines.
  </p>
  <p>
   Blocks have the following format:
  </p>

  <p class = "header">Sprite RAM Bug</p>
  
  <p>
   There is a flaw in the GameBoy hardware that causes trash to be written to OAM RAM if the following commands
   are used while their 16-bit content is in the range of $FE00 to $FEFF:
   <pre>
      inc   rp     (rp = bc, de, or hl)
      dec   rp

      ldi   a, (hl)
      ldd   a, (hl)

      ldi   (hl), a
      ldd   (hl), a
   </pre>
   Only sprites 1 & 2 ($FE00 & $FE04) are not affected by these instructions.
  </p>
  
  <p class = "header">Sound</p>
  
  <p>
   There are two sound channels connected to the output terminals SO1 and SO2. There is also a input terminal Vin
   connected to the cartridge. It can be routed to either of both output terminals. GameBoy circuitry allows
   producing sound in four different ways:
   <ul type="circle">
    <li>Quadrangular wave patterns with sweep and envelope functions</li>
    <li>Quadrangular wave patterns with envelope functions</li>
    <li>Voluntary wave patterns from wave RAM</li>
    <li>White noise with an envelope function</li>
   </ul>
   These four sounds can be controlled independantly and then mixed separately for each of the output terminals.
   Sound registers may be set at all times while producing sound.
   <br>
   When setting the initial value of the envelope and restarting the length counter, set the initial flag to 1
   and initialize the data.
  </p>
  <p>
   Under the following situations the Sound ON flag is reset and the sound output stops:
   <ol type="1">
    <li>When the sound output is stopped by the length counter</li>
    <li>When overflow occurs at the addition mode while sweep is operating at sound 1.</li>
   </ol>
   When the Sound OFF flag for sound 3 (bit 7 of NR30) is set at 0, the cancellation of the OFF mode must be done
   by setting the sound OFF flag to 1. By initializing sound 3, it starts it's function.
   <br>
   When the All Sound OFF flag (bit 7 of NR52) is set to 0, the mode registers for sounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 are
   reset and the sound output stops.
  </p>
  <p>
   <blue>
    NOTE: The setting of each sounds mode register must be done after the All Sound OFF mode is cancelled. During
    the All Sound OFF mode, each sound mode register cannot be set.
   </blue>
  </p>
  <p>
   NOTE: During the all sound off mode, GB power consumption drops by 16% or more! While your programs aren't
   using sound then set the all sound off flag to 0. It defaults to 1 on reset.
  </p>
  <p>
   These tend to be the two most important equations in converting between Hertz and GB frequency registers:
   (Sounds will have a 2.4% higher frequency on Super GB.)
   <pre>
      gb = 2048 - (131072 / Hz)             Hz  = 131072 / (2048 - gb)
   </pre>
  </p>
  
  <p class = "header">Timer</p>
  
  <p>
   Sometimes it's useful to have a timer that interrupts at regular intervals for routines that require periodic
   or percise updates. The timer in the GameBoy has a selectable frequency of 4096, 16384, 65536, or 262144
   Hertz. This frequency increments the Timer Counter (TIMA). When it overflows, it generates an interrupt. It is
   then loaded with the contents of Timer Modulo (TMA). The following are examples:
   <pre>
 ;This interval timer interrupts 4096 times per second

     ld  a,-1
     ld  ($FF06),a     ;Set TMA to divide clock by 1
     ld  a,4
     ld  ($FF07),a     ;Set clock to 4096 Hertz

 ;This interval timer interrupts 65536 times per second

     ld  a,-4
     ld  ($FF06),a     ;Set TMA to divide clock by 4
     ld  a,5
     ld  ($FF07),a     ;Set clock to 262144 Hertz
   </pre>
  </p>
  
  <p class = "header">Serial I/O</p>
  
  <p>
   The serial I/O port on the Gameboy is a very simple setup and is crude compared to standard RS-232 (IBM-PC) or
   RS-485 (Macintosh) serial ports. There are no start or stop bits so the programmer must be more creative when
   using this port.
   <br>
   During a transfer, a byte is shifted in at the same time that a byte is shifted out. The rate of the shift is
   deter- mined by whether the clock source is internal or external. If internal, the bits are shifted out at a
   rate of 8192Hz (122 microseconds) per bit. The most significant bit is shifted in and out first.
  </p>
  <p>
   When the internal clock is selected, it drives the clock pin on the game link port and it stays high when not
   used. During a transfer it will go low eight times to clock in/out each bit.
  </p>
  <p>
   A programmer initates a serial transfer by setting bit 7 of $FF02. This bit may be read and is automatically
   set to 0 at the completion of transfer. After this bit is set, an interrupt will then occur eight bit clocks
   later if the serial interrupt is enabled. If internal clock is selected and serial interrupt is enabled, this
   interrupt occurs 122*8 microseconds later. If external clock is selected and serial interrupt is enabled, an
   interrupt will occur eight bit clocks later.
  </p>
  <p>
   Initiating a serial transfer with external clock will wait forever if no external clock is present. This
   allows a certain amount of synchronization with each serial port.
   <br>
   The state of the last bit shifted out determines the state of the output line until another transfer takes
   place.
  </p>
  <p>
   If a serial transfer with internal clock is performed and no external GameBoy is present, a value of $FF will
   be received in the transfer.
   <br>
   The following code causes $75 to be shifted out the serial port and a byte to be shifted into $FF01:
   <pre>
      ld   a,$75
      ld  ($FF01),a
      ld   a,$81
      ld  ($FF02),a
   </pre>
  </p>
  
  <p class = "header">Interrupt Procedure</p>
  
  <p>
   The IME (interrupt master enable) flag is reset by DI and prohibits all interrupts. It is set by EI and
   acknowledges the interrupt setting by the IE register.
   <ol type="1">
    <li>When an interrupt is generated, the IF flag will be set</li>
    <li>If the IME flag is set & the corresponding IE flag is set, the following 3 steps are performed</li>
    <li>Reset the IME flag and prevent all interrupts</li>
    <li>The PC (program counter) is pushed onto the stack</li>
    <li>Jump to the starting address of the interrupt</li>
   </ol>
   Resetting of the IF register, which was the cause of the interrupt, is done by hardware.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the interrupt, pushing of registers to be used should be performed by the interrupt routine.
   <br>
   Once the interrupt service is in progress, all the interrupts will be prohibited. However, if the IME flag and
   the IE flag are controlled, a number of interrupt services can be made possible by nesting.
  </p>
  <p>
   Return from an interrupt routine can be performed by either RETI or RET instruction.
   <br>
   The RETI instruction enables interrupts after doing a return operation.
  </p>
  <p>
   If a RET is used as the final instruction in an interrupt routine, interrupts will remain disabled unless a EI
   was used in the interrupt routine or is used at a later time.
   <br>
   The interrupt will be acknowledged during opcode fetch period of each instruction.
  </p>
  
  <p class = "header">Interrupt Descriptions</p>
  
  <p>
   The following interrupts only occur if they have been enabled in the Interrupt Enable register ($FFFF) and if
   the interrupts have actually been enabled using the EI instruction.
   <table cellpadding="5" border="0">
    <tr>
     <td valign="top">V-Blank</td>
     <td>
      The V-Blank interrupt occurs ~59.7 times a second on a regular GB and ~61.1 times a second on a Super GB
      (SGB). This interrupt occurs at the beginning of the V-Blank period. During this period video hardware is
      not using video ram so it may be freely accessed. This period lasts approximately 1.1 milliseconds.
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td valign="top">LCDC Status</td>
     <td>
      There are various reasons for this interrupt to occur as described by the STAT register ($FF40). One very
      popular reason is to indicate to the user when the video hardware is about to redraw a given LCD line. This
      can be useful for dynamically controlling the SCX / SCY registers ($FF43 / $FF42) to perform special video
      effects.

     <td>
      This interrupt occurs on a transition of any of the keypad input lines from high to low. Due to the fact
      that keypad "bounce"* is virtually always present, software should expect this interrupt to occur one or
      more times for every button press and one or more times for every button release.
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
  </p>
  <p>
   Bounce tends to be a side effect of any button making or breaking a connection. During these periods, it is
   very common for a small amount of oscillation between high & low states to take place.

                        11: During Transfering Data to LCD Driver

     STAT shows the current status of the LCD controller.
     Mode 00: When the flag is 00 it is the H-Blank period and the CPU can access the display RAM
              ($8000-$9FFF).

     Mode 01: When the flag is 01 it is the V-Blank period and the CPU can access the display RAM
              ($8000-$9FFF).

     Mode 10: When the flag is 10 then the OAM is being used ($FE00-$FE9F). The CPU cannot access
              the OAM during this period

     Mode 11: When the flag is 11 both the OAM and display RAM are being used. The CPU cannot 
              access either during this period.


     The following are typical when the display is enabled:

Mode 0  000___000___000___000___000___000___000________________
Mode 1  _______________________________________11111111111111__
Mode 2  ___2_____2_____2_____2_____2_____2___________________2_
Mode 3  ____33____33____33____33____33____33__________________3


      The Mode Flag goes through the values 0, 2, and 3 at a cycle of about 109uS. 0 is
      present about 48.6uS, 2 about 19uS, and 3 about 41uS. This is interrupted every
      16.6ms by the VBlank (1). The mode flag stays set at 1 for about 1.08 ms. (Mode 0
      is present between 201-207 clks, 2 about 77-83 clks, and 3 about 169-175 clks. A
      complete cycle through these states takes 456 clks. VBlank lasts 4560 clks. A
      complete screen refresh occurs every 70224 clks.)

            The LY indicates the vertical line to which the present data is transferred
	    to the LCD Driver. The LY can take on any value between 0 through 153. The
	    values between 144 and 153 indicate the V-Blank period. Writing will reset
	    the counter.

            The LYC compares itself with the LY. If the values are the same it causes
	    the STAT to set the coincident flag.

FF46
   Name     - DMA
   Contents - DMA Transfer and Start Address (W)

   The DMA Transfer (40*28 bit) from internal ROM or RAM ($0000-$F19F) to the OAM
   (address $FE00-$FE9F) can be performed. It takes 160 microseconds for the transfer.

   40*28 bit = #140 or #$8C.  As you can see, it only transfers $8C bytes of data. OAM
   data is $A0 bytes long, from $0-$9F.

   But if you examine the OAM data you see that 4 bits are not in use.

   40*32 bit = #$A0, but since 4 bits for each OAM is not used it's 40*28 bit.

   It transfers all the OAM data to OAM RAM.

   The DMA transfer start address can be designated every $100 from address $0000-$F100.
   That means $0000, $0100, $0200, $0300....

   As can be seen by looking at register $FF41 Sprite RAM ($FE00 - $FE9F) is not always
   available. A simple routine that many games use to write data to Sprite memory is
   shown below. Since it copies data to the sprite RAM at the appro- priate times it
   removes that responsibility from the main program.
   All of the memory space, except high ram ($FF80-$FFFE), is not accessible during DMA.
   Because of this, the routine below must be copied & executed in high ram. It is
   usually called from a V-blank Interrupt.

   Example program:

      org   $40
      jp    VBlank

      org   $ff80
VBlank:
      push  af           &lt;- Save A reg & flags
      ld    a, BASE_ADRS &lt;- transfer data from BASE_ADRS
      ld    ($ff46), a   &lt;- put A into DMA registers
      ld    a, 28h       &lt;- loop length
Wait:                    &lt;- We need to wait 160 microseconds.
      dec   a            &lt;-  4 cycles - decrease A by 1
      jr    nz, Wait     &lt;- 12 cycles - branch if Not Zero to Wait
      pop   af           &lt;- Restore A reg & flags
      reti               &lt;- Return from interrupt

   Name     - BGP
   Contents - BG & Window Palette Data  (R/W)

              Bit 7-6 - Data for Dot Data 11 (Normally darkest color)

              Bit 3-2 - Data for Dot Data 01
              Bit 1-0 - Data for Dot Data 00 (Normally lightest color)

              This selects the shade of grays to use for the background (BG) & window
	      pixels. Since each pixel uses 2 bits, the corresponding shade will be
	      selected from here.

   Name     - WY
   Contents - Window Y Position  (R/W)

              0 &lt;= WY &lt;= 143

              WY must be greater than or equal to 0 and must be less than or equal to
	      143 for window to be visible.

FF4B
   Name     - WX
   Contents - Window X Position  (R/W)

              0 &lt;= WX &lt;= 166

              WX must be greater than or equal to 0 and must be less than or equal to
	      166 for window to be visible.

              WX is offset from absolute screen coordinates by 7. Setting the window to
	      WX=7, WY=0 will put the upper left corner of the window at absolute screen
	      coordinates 0,0.

              Lets say WY = 70 and WX = 87. The window would be positioned as so:

               0                  80               159
